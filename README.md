# The Hamming distance

## Description

This is a React web application built using Vite, which calculates the Hamming distance between two strings. The Hamming distance is a measure of the difference between two strings of equal length. It is calculated as the number of positions at which the corresponding characters differ. This application provides a simple and interactive way to find the Hamming distance for any pair of strings entered by the user.
